<h1 id="tldr">TL;DR</h1>

<p>Be nice. Be mature. Follow the law. Listen to the mods. Ask your question
directly (<em>don’t ask to ask</em>) and don’t post across multiple channels or ask
people for programming help in DMs.</p>

<h1 id="in-full">In full</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the Discord service guidelines: <a href="https://discordapp.com/guidelines">https://discordapp.com/guidelines</a> This
is a welcoming community. All forms of abuse, belittlement, and rudeness are
strictly forbidden. This includes unsubstantiated language/technology bashing,
unprompted aggression, and anything unpleasant that someone else asks you to
cease.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Memes and shitposts are not allowed outside of #off-topic, and they are
discouraged in general. Excessive meme/shitpost spam will lead to kick/ban.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Post your questions directly if you want help, without fear. Please do not
ask for explicit permission; that is unnecessary and forces people to wait
for your return.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please try using a search engine before asking your question.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While we try to help everybody whatever their question, there are many
answers on the Internet and you may not need live help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone on this server is a volunteer. We forbid monetary offers outside of
job listings in #hire-people, which has very strict rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not help with breaking the law or breaching any software, API’s or
Terms of Service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not post or discuss NSFW/NSFL or illegal content (this includes
nicknames).  Do not post or discuss piracy content. Do not post or discuss
political content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No unsolicited advertisement (invite links, referral links, etc.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are having trouble deciding which channel to post in, choose whatever
is closest. We are lenient about channel separation because everyone is in
every channel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Post your question in one and only one channel before waiting for a
response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cross posting will not get you an answer sooner, and it will split the
discussion into redundant and/or conflicting answers. Directing people to
your question is a better strategy than reposting it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No unsolicited DMs. Do not DM other users for help regarding programming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Mods cannot moderate DMs,it is better for your learning to have as many
eyes on the problem as possible, and silent others may benefit from your
questions’ answers.</p>

    <p><em>Note: you are always welcome to message the Mods for any server-related
issues.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are a student, we will follow academic honesty guidelines and refrain
from helping where would be unethical for us to do so, such as on homework
or exams. In the same vein, we will not provide help for ongoing
competitions that forbid seeking outside help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ask specific questions about your issue, and respect that everyone in this
server is a volunteer. We are not servants who will write your programs for
you, so we will refrain from helping people who expect spoonfeeding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some channels have additional rules, specified below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These rules are not up for personal interpretations. There are no loopholes
or technicalities. Mods enforce these rules according to the spirit of these
rules, and arguing that some bad behavior is not covered by these rules may
lead to a kick/ban.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="security-channel">#security channel</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We do not help and we will immediately stop helping anyone judged to be
pushing any legal boundaries or trying to circumvent any entity’s Terms of
Service.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No pentesting any other entity’s system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are not sure that something is malicious, assume it is by default.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want help with something that could potentially be used maliciously,
it is on you to demonstrate exactly how you are using it and why your
use-case is not malicious.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Breaking any of these #security rules will get you banned from this channel
on first offense.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hire-people-channel">#hire-people channel</h2>

<p>Every listing in #hire-people will adhere to these minimum requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A functional link to an official job posting without link shortening (we
make allowances here for peer-to-peer gigs, but a link is preferred),</p>
  </li>

low.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether the position is direct-hire or contract,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not be a request for an academic integrity violation or a subcontract, Do
not write “DM if interested.” Respond to questions on the server. Your post
implies that they can DM you if they choose to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Job posters: Any post that does not conform to these rules will be removed
and the poster will be warned/disciplined as appropriate. Keep in mind that
these are minimum requirements. You are encouraged to exceed them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Job seekers: Remember to protect yourself. The server is not liable if you
get scammed, but you are encouraged to come forward to a Mod if a job poster
is dishonest. We will definitely discipline them as appropriate.
Additionally, in this context, personal information should be exchanged via
DM.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="forms-of-punishment">Forms of punishment</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Informal warning:</strong> Warning of potential breaking of the rules in chat,
usually kept between a Mod and a user. Intended as a precaution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Formal warning:</strong> Same as above, but will be logged for consideration
before future punishments. There is no formal number of warnings required
before more serious punishment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Kick:</strong> The user is expelled from the server, but they are free to return.
Kicks will only be issued once per user.</p>

    <p><strong>Temporary ban:</strong> Expulsion for a set period of time. Duration of the ban
is at the Mod’s discretion.</p>

too extreme or after several repeated offenses.</p>

after a change of heart, or after careful consideration if you wish to
accuse a Mod of abuse.</p>
